- 👋 Hi, I’m @sshscramble1
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to remidiate malicious code and network administration
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java script and Windows Shell
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on stopping this very malicious hacker who has been stalking me from this platform for 6 years.  He has cost me so far 5 bank accounts, my credit ruined, and a loss of more than $16,000 in ruined devices.  Anyone taking an interest in helping me must know reverse shell.
- I have already tried Microsoft to many times to count and changrd my ISP 3 times, he is back within days usually. I recently kept him out for 4 months but with using nfc, radio frequency, and "ping", as well as bots using backdoor trojans to the tune of over 17,000 attempts in 24 hr period, he always gets back in.
- He taunts me with personal messages in these backdoor trojans with things like "I_CAN_SEE_YOU", "I gooble your ssh, and "I_exploit_you_name", and much worse! I believe there are ethical hackers and hope to find one on this platform to help me.

- 📫 How to reach me you can text me @(386) 339-9771
- 😄 Pronouns: Her, She, etc.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was a professional singer/guitar player throughout the late 80's and 90's until I got pregnant with Twins in 2000.
